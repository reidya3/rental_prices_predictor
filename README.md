## Background <a name="background"></a>
I wanted to understand rental price behaviour in Dublin against various features such as location and the size of the property. My goal was to create a model that predicted the rental price based on such attributes so that I could make a more informed decision, when I try to enter the rental market next year. Rent.ie is Ireland's newest and freshest lettings website offering renters an alternative to the Daft lettings section when looking for rental accommodation and flatshares. They are focused on 18-25 year olds and aim to be the top renting website for this demographic.
